# Hangman

A simple hangman game where users are to guess letters of a programming language name randomly by the computer from a list of names. The user is given 8 lives to begin with and loses lives if the guess is incorrect. The user is notified if the guess has been guessed before and is not penalized for the attempt. The user is notified if the guess is of an invalid character and intructed with the correct input required.

Code syntax summary:
Good implementation of nested loops and boolean logic to control program flow. As well as thorough use of string methods and module properties to create complex logic throughout code and user interaction.
